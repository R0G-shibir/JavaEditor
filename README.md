Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed (e.g., JDK 8 or later). You can download it from [Oracle JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) or [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/).
- Git (for cloning the repository).
